Android Application Projects
This repository contains two Android applications, both developed in Android Studio using the Java programming language.

Project 1: Quote of the Day App
This application provides users with daily inspiration by displaying quotes from a large, predefined list. It demonstrates how to handle data from an external file and manage a non-repeating sequence of content.

Features
Non-Repeating Quotes: The app reads a large number of quotes from an external quotes.txt file, ensuring users see a new, unique quote with every tap.

Quote Sharing: Users can easily share quotes with others via any app that supports text sharing.

Custom Design: The app features a custom "Q" logo and a clean, user-friendly interface.

How to Run
Open the project in Android Studio.

Build and run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.

Project 2: To-Do List App
This application is a feature-rich to-do list that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a local database. It uses gestures to manage tasks, providing a more intuitive user experience.

Features
Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in a local SQLite database, so they are saved even after the app is closed.

Gesture-Based Interaction: Users can single-tap to edit a task, double-tap to toggle its completion status, and long-press to delete it.

Task Management: The app allows users to add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks.

User-Friendly Interface: Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strikethrough and a change in color.

How to Run
Open the project in Android Studio.

Build and run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.
